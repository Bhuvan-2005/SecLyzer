## 🔐 PERSISTENCE GUARANTEE

Your context is protected by:

✅ **NOT in git**
- Added to `.gitignore` so it won't be committed
- Won't pollute your commits
- Safe from accidental uploads

✅ **ON DISK** (survives everything)
- Profile changes → still there ✅
- Profile switches → still there ✅
- Come back 3 months later → still there ✅
- Git clones → still there ✅

✅ **LOCAL ONLY**
- Stored in `/home/bhuvan/Documents/Projects/SecLyzer/.warp-local/`
- Part of your repo directory
- On your machine, not cloud

✅ **READABLE BY ALL PROFILES**
- Any Warp profile sees same files
- No profile-specific magic
- Just regular files on disk

## ⚡ QUICK START (Right Now)

### Read in This Order

**Option A: 5 Minutes**
```bash
cat .warp-local/CONTEXT_SNAPSHOT.md
```
You'll know: What SecLyzer is, why it's at 4.5/10, what to do next

**Option B: 1 Hour**
```bash
cat .warp-local/CONTEXT_SNAPSHOT.md        # 5 min
cat .warp-local/PRODUCTION_READINESS_AUDIT.md | head -300  # 40 min  
cat .warp-local/SPRINT_2WEEKS.md | head -100  # 15 min
```
You'll know: Everything wrong, how to fix it, exact plan

**Option C: 5 Hours (Deep)**
```bash
cat .warp-local/README.md
cat .warp-local/CONTEXT_SNAPSHOT.md
cat .warp-local/PRODUCTION_READINESS_AUDIT.md
cat .warp-local/SPRINT_2WEEKS.md
cat .warp-local/DEEP_CODE_ANALYSIS.md
```
You'll know: Everything about your project and how to build production systems

---

## ✅ VERIFY YOUR CONTEXT IS SAFE

Run this anytime to check:

```bash
cd /home/bhuvan/Documents/Projects/SecLyzer
bash .warp-local/verify_context.sh
```

Expected output:
```
✓ In correct directory
✓ README.md
✓ CONTEXT_SNAPSHOT.md
✓ PRODUCTION_READINESS_AUDIT.md
✓ SPRINT_2WEEKS.md
✓ DEEP_CODE_ANALYSIS.md
✓ CODEBASE_AUDIT.md
